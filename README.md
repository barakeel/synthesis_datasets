These are the datasets accompanying the paper 
Deep Reinforcement Learning for Synthesizing Functions in Higher-Order Logic.

The ``combin_target`` and ``dioph_target`` contains the generated datasets.

In each directory, the files ``train_export`` and ``test_export`` gives you 
respectively the training and the testing set of problems.
Each problem is followed by one possible solution on the next line.

The other files in these directories contains the same data in a format easily readable from HOL4.

The TPTP problems for combinators are available in the ``TPTP/train`` and 
``TPTP/test`` directories.
